# Action Angle Variables via Birkhoff Normalization
Routines for examples for computing AA variables via Birkhoff Normalization in
axisymmetric galactic potentials. These routines are build around the
[``celmech``](https://github.com/shadden/celmech) Python package which can be
installed via PyPI using `pip install celmech`
